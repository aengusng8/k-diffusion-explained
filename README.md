# k-diffusion-explained

## Math Derivations
The math derivations in the repository provide a detailed explanation of the k-diffusion and its mathematical properties. These derivations are written in a clear and concise manner, making them accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of probability and statistics.

## Code Comments
The code comments in the repository provide a step-by-step explanation of the implementation of k-diffusion. 

## Instructional Videos
The videos are designed to be intuitive, engaging and informative, making them an ideal resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of generative modeling.

## TODO List
- Create a k-diffusion code walkthrough video to help users better understand the implementation
- Add LaTeX math derivations
- Add comments to the code to improve readability and make it easier to follow the implementation
- Create an additional k-diffusion intuition-focused video
